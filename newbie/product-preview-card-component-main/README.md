## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology

### What I learned

I learned semantic html and custom properties with css using a graph tools to write clean code. I use vim as my IDE btw.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<article>
  <header>
    Logo
    <img />
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>text</p>
    <div>price <span>tached</span></div>
    <button><img /></button>
  </section>
</article>
```

```css
:root {
  --my-custom-properties: value;
}
```

### Continued development

[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) as a path for Frontend Developer.
